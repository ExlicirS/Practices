## Practices
> Just some MumboJumbo of codes gathered from multiple tutorial sources. Will be adding description on anything that I believe I need to take notes on for myself.

### Technical Terms 
> Terms used a lot through programmers. *terms that aren't beginner friendly, well, for me at least.*
###### **Calling a function**
> A term programmers use to ask to run the function.

_eg. ```int main() { FunctionExample() }``` //write the function, to call the function_

### **C++ Data Types**
> Data types that could be used in C++ language.
##### **For numbers**
> Whole numbers: ```int x```

> Decimals: ```double x, float x```
