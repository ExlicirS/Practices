# Practices
> Just some MumboJumbo of codes gathered from multiple tutorial sources. Will be adding description on anything that I believe I need to take notes on for myself.

# Technical Terms
###### **Calling a function**
> A term programmers use to ask to run the function.

_eg. int main() { FunctionExample() } //enter function, to call the function_
