## Practices
> Just some MumboJumbo of codes gathered from multiple tutorial sources. Will be adding description on anything that I believe I need to take notes on for myself.

### Technical Terms 
######Terms used a lot through programmers. _terms that aren't beginner friendly, well, for me at least.
###### **Calling a function**
> A term programmers use to ask to run the function.

_eg. int main() { FunctionExample() } //enter function, to call the function_
